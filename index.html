      <h2>Welcome to your happy place</h2>
      <p>
        Her beauty is an irresistible force that pulls me in,<br />
        Like a gravitational field, a captivating spin,<br />
        A cosmic mystery, vast and infinite in scope,<br />
        Beyond my comprehension, beyond my human hope.<br /><br />

        Her radiance, a brilliant star that shines so bright,<br />
        Illuminates my world with pure, unbridled light,<br />
        A celestial body, a work of art so fine,<br />
        A heavenly creation that ignites my soul and mind.<br /><br />

        Her elegance, a dance of planets in space,<br />
        A symphony of grace, a wondrous, dazzling embrace,<br />
        A cosmic tapestry, a sight to behold,<br />
        A galaxy of beauty, a story that's yet to be told.<br /><br />

        Her beauty, like a supernova's intense light,<br />
        A blaze of glory that ignites my very sight,<br />
        A celestial essence, beyond measure or compare,<br />
        Leaves me in awe, a cosmic treasure that's rare.<br /><br />

        She's a universe, an endless expanse so grand,<br />
        A creation beyond all human understanding or command,<br />
        A constellation of beauty and grace so divine,<br />
        A cosmic wonder, a heavenly embrace that's mine.<br /><br />

        Her eyes, a window to the universe vast,<br />
        A cosmic mystery, that forever will last.<br />
        A depth of beauty, a soulful retreat,<br />
        A galaxy of stars, where my heart finds its beat.<br />
        Oh her eyes, like the moon's luminous light,<br />
        Captivate me with their gleam so bright.<br /><br />

        Her hair, a comet's trail so rare,<br />
        A stream of light, floating on air.<br />
        A cosmic beauty, a celestial sight,<br />
        That enchants my soul, in its heavenly flight.<br />
        Oh her hair, like a comet's radiant trail,<br />
        Is a sight to behold, so stunning and hale.<br /><br />

        Her fingers, like constellations in the sky,<br />
        A symphony of grace and poise, that never die.<br />
        A cosmic dance, a delicate flow,<br />
        That takes me to a universe, where love will grow.<br /><br />

        Her arms, a galaxy's embrace so wide,<br />
        A universe of love, by my side.<br />
        A starry night, I get lost in,<br />
        A cosmic journey, that's always within.<br /><br />

        Her waist, a planet's perfect round,<br />
        A celestial creation, that's forever bound.<br />
        A dance of light, a cosmic flow,<br />
        That sets me free, and lets me go.<br /><br />

        Her legs, like comets, in graceful flight,<br />
        Dancing with stars, in the cosmic light.<br />
        A cosmic wonder, that takes me higher,<br />
        A universe in motion, with a celestial fire.<br /><br />

        She is a universe in herself, a divine creation,<br />
        A heavenly body, whose beauty is a revelation.<br />
        Her elegance, her charm, her grace, her poise,<br />
        Make me cherish every moment, every single noise.<br /><br />

        With her, I soar through the cosmic skies,<br />
        Lost in the depths of her enchanting eyes.<br />
        In her arms, I find a haven, a place to rest,<br />
        A place where I feel complete, my heart at its best.<br />
